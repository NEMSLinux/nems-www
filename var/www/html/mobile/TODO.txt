on my device to see if the problem is from there but all to no avail..here is a log from apache i am getting
================================================================================================
Hi - I'm getting the same issue with my BB Bold 9000. There are no errors in the error_log, however - the access_log shows that apache is responding to the requests for CSS and JS with HTTP status 401. This doesn't happen if I access it direct from my PC browser (or from iPhone).

The following logs have just CSS requests shown:

Notice that each request is sent twice, once without a username (hence returning 401 not authorized), then once with a username (returning http 304).
Note that I too can access and view all features of nagiosmobile, except for the CSS and JS.
